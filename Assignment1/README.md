This is homework assigntment #1. In this assigment I created 3 html pages and one css style sheet to be applied to each page.

I formatted each page according to the .pngs supplied with the assignment. I used position absolut and relative to layout boxes on my web pages.

I used border styles to add horizontal lines the the header, h2 and footer sections.

I'm please with the results having felt very excited to achieve so much in such a little time.
